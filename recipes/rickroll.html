    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided, or as needed</li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope instant yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, you know the rules and so do I, combine 3/4 cup flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li> Heat milk, water, and 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan until very warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees F).</li>
        <li>Add warm milk mixture to the flour mixture. Beat for 2 minutes on medium speed of an electric mixer, scraping the bowl occasionally. Add 1/4 cup flour; beat for 2 minutes at high speed. Stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough.</li>
        <li> Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Cover; let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>A full commitment's what I'm thinking of, so preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 20 minutes. Serve warm. You wouldn't get this from any other guy!</li>
    </ol>

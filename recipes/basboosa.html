    <p>Four slices of golden-brown basboosa, each with an almond on top, on a plate.</p>

    <P> <em> Basboosa</em> or <em>Harrissa</em> is a Middle Eastern dessert made from semolina and coconut, drenched in a sweet rose water syrup. Some add tahini to give it a tangy tase, or honey to add some earthy sweetness, but I prefer the simpler method of just regular sugar and no tahini.</P>

    <p>This dessert is both easy and a crowd-pleaser. No eggs and simple ingredients that you can just throw together? Yes please! The hardest part of this recipe is not eating all of the blanched almonds (which if placed evenly, will give the appearence of hard work). </p>
